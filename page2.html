<div><p class="dotted"><br>Sian's interest in coding stemmed from a young age, when the Internet was first invented. She spent hours creating webpages on all weird and wonderful topics when she was a child, which then led to building her own websites and dollmakers (who remembers those!) using iframes and too much coding. This then led to the customising of Myspace, making sure she used every code she could to have the fanciest profile, and then fast track to now where she has a lifestyle and fitness blog that she tweaks in her spare time.<br></p> <br><img src="http://pakasdollmaker.com/flagdolls.GIF"></center></p>
